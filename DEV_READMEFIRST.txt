Purposes:
- web / py4web: Anything non-customer facing web ui and API related 
- jobs / ansible: for setting up the environment during build and run, not the actual application itself
- ansible vs python: use ansible to create folders, set perms, grab files, etc. to setup the environment as much as possible but the actual logic portion should be python3.11+
